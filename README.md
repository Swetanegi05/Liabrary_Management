# Library Management Project

This is a PostgreSQL project that simulates a library management system.  
It contains SQL scripts to create tables, insert sample data, and perform queries.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project demonstrates how a library database can be designed and managed using PostgreSQL.  
It includes tables for books, members, issued books, and returns.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Download the file `library_management.sql`
2. Open **pgAdmin** or PostgreSQL command line
3. Create a new database (example: `library_management`)
4. Run the script `library_management.sql` to create tables and insert data
5. Execute queries to manage and analyze library operations

## 📊 Skills Demonstrated
- Database design
- SQL commands: `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`
- Joins and relationships
- Handling book issue/return records

## 📂 File in this Repository
- `library_management.sql` → SQL script for the entire project
